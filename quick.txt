Sir,
If you only watch one video, watch 006.mkv.



******************************

001.mp4 -

Likely observed with a TB2 [1] with "black hot IR", this video shows five or more Russian vehicles in close proximity, with no effective concealment techniques employed. At approximately 10 seconds in to the recording, a UI Ukrainian munition (likely an air-launched missile) destroys what appears to be a wheeled, command variant vehicle. The uploaded video was recorded with a mobile phone pointed at the UAS control terminal; the glare at the top of the screen was a light from within the room.

"Last couple TB2 vids have looked like Ukraine has started hunting down Russian army command post. Possibly where the last couple generals and high ranking officers were killed"

Once again likely observed with a TB2 [1] with "black hot IR"-- this video depicts two or more Russian vehicles in close proximity, with no effective concealment techniques employed. They are destroyed at approximately 10 seconds in to the recording by a UI Ukrainian munition (likely an air-launched missile). At 19 seconds, the operator changes from "black hot IR" to standard color FMV. The uploaded video was recorded with a mobile phone pointed at the UAS control terminal or a laptop.

*** Mute prior to watching ***
Observed by upwards of six likely TB2 [1] with "black hot IR"-- this video depicts multiple angles of multiple Russian vehicles on a road. Impacts of a possible Ukrainian artillery barrage are seen at four seconds, seven seconds, 11 seconds, 19 seconds, 21 seconds, and 29 seconds. The uploaded video was recorded with a mobile phone pointed at a laptop.


Although there are coordinates displayed on screen (46° 49' 41"N, 32° 29' 33"E), the low quality of the video renders it exceptionally difficult to confirm this. Commercial satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe was last taken on 14 Dec 21. [2]

Observed by an unknown UAS type with standard color FMV this video shows multiple artillery impacts on a grouping of vehicles, some of which are partially concealed in a nearby treeline. The quantity of vehicles indicates this is the TOC of at least a BDE/RGT sized element. The lack of dismounted personnel moving after the initial impacts indicate either: a) the TOC was abandonded; or, 2) the Russian TTP for incoming artillery is to stay in place and pray.
